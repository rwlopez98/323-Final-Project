# 323-Final-Project
An android app that I designed and developed from the ground up as part of my final project for CSCI-323. This application is a location based reminder app that is integrated into a custom Firebase Database to send push notifications to the user when they come in the come into the vicinity of a location they have a task they need to complete.
